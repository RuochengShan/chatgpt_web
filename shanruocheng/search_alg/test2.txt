Title: Lessons learned from the World Bank's engagement in Panama
Source: World Bank

Categories:
- Strategic level lessons learned
- Operational level lessons learned

Bullet points:
- (Line 2.16) Weaknesses in public management limit the effectiveness of investment programs. Prioritizing this topic in the Bank's actions with the country could help improve the effectiveness of public investment projects in general.
- (Line 2.16) Evaluating the political feasibility of institutional change in the sectors prioritized in the strategy is key to determining the sequence and structure of the Bank's program and the scope of the expected outcomes during the period.
- (Line 2.16) To support and sustain the reforms fostered by the policy programs, they must be complemented with sector and technical cooperation operations to help the expected outcomes from the reforms to materialize in a timely way.
- (Line 2.16) The approach to crosscutting themes like diversity and cultural relevance required extensive and comprehensive support from the analysis of the technical challenges, dialogue with indigenous comarcas to identify needs and solutions, and coordination of a flexible multisectoral response by the Bank.
- (Line 2.16) Making headway on the climate change agenda requires dialogue with the authorities to identify policies and investments contributing to the country's commitments under its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).
- (Line 2.17) Given Panama's good access to external financing, the Bank's value at the operational level lies in its technical contribution and capacity to support executing agencies on project implementation.
- (Line 2.17) Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable population groups effectively requires an investment in substantive dialogue with beneficiaries to achieve relevant solutions, and technical cooperation resources that support operation preparation and execution.
- (Line 2.17) Early definition of land titling mitigates the risks of delay to execution of infrastructure works.
- (Line 2.17) To improve execution, there need to be realistic estimates of the time the CGR requires for ex ante review of individual contracting processes and associated payments.
============= 16 ==============
Summary:

Categories: Country Strategy, Priority Areas

- Lines 1-2: The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has approved a new country strategy for Panama for the period 2021-2024.

============= 17 ==============
1. Lines 1-9, Economy: Panama's economy has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a projected contraction of 9% in 2020. The country's economic growth has been slowing down since 2017, and the pandemic has exacerbated this trend. The tourism and construction sectors have been particularly affected.

2. Lines 10-18, Employment: The pandemic has also had a significant impact on employment, with the unemployment rate rising from 6.4% in 2019 to 18.5% in 2020. Informal workers have been hit the hardest, with a 30% drop in their income.

3. Lines 19-29, Institutional Weaknesses: Panama's institutional weaknesses, particularly in public management, represent a major challenge in managing the current crisis and spurring an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. The country's tax revenues have been falling, and the tax system is an obstacle to business development. The public deficit has been expanding, and spending management needs to become more efficient.

4. Lines 30-35, Tax Administration: Between 2014 and 2019, Panama's tax revenues fell from 10.1% of GDP to 8.7%, the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America and the Caribbean. The tax system has narrow bases and low rates, and there are high levels of noncompliance. The tax administration is inefficient and outdated.

5. Lines 36-41, Business Development: Despite its low revenue collection capacity, the tax system is an obstacle to business development in Panama. The country ranks 176th out of 191 countries analyzed under the category of "tax payments" in the World Bank's Doing Business indicators. The tax administration is outdated and ineffective.
============= 18 ==============
Summary:

- Panama's public management is weak, with delays in execution and a loss of efficiency and transparency in the use of resources. (Lines 3.6-3.7) Category: Governance
- The country has climbed 15 places on the latest United Nations e-government ranking, but still ranks 84th worldwide. (Line 3.7) Category: Technology

- The IDB Group will support public management modernization efforts, digital transformation of public administration, and strengthening of analytic and planning capacity of sector ministries. (Line 3.8) Category: Development Aid
============= 19 ==============
Summary:

- Lines summarized: 1-3
- Category: Introduction
- Panama's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant contraction. The country faces several challenges, including inequality, poverty, and weak institutions. The government has launched a plan to address these issues and promote sustainable development.

- Lines summarized: 4-7
- Category: Economic challenges
- Panama's economy has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a projected contraction of 9% in 2020. The country's dependence on international trade and tourism has made it vulnerable to external shocks. The government has implemented measures to support businesses and households, but more needs to be done to ensure a sustainable recovery.

- Lines summarized: 8-11
- Category: Social challenges
- Panama faces significant social challenges, including high levels of inequality, poverty, and unemployment. These issues are particularly acute in rural areas and indigenous communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, highlighting the need for a more inclusive and equitable society.

- Lines summarized: 12-15
- Category: Health challenges
- Panama's health system faces several challenges, including high maternal and infant mortality rates, inadequate water and sanitation services, and climate vulnerability. The COVID-19 pandemic has made these challenges more pressing, highlighting the need for improved health infrastructure and services.

- Lines summarized: 16-19
- Category: Educational challenges
- Panama's educational system is weak, hindering social mobility and productivity. Many students do not develop adequate skills, and there are significant differences in access depending on income level. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation, with many students at risk of dropping out due to the lack of effective distance learning. Indigenous communities face additional challenges, requiring a differentiated response aligned with bilingual intercultural education.
============= 20 ==============
Summary:

- Line 3: Business Environment
- Panama faces challenges in hiring workers with required skills, which is the third biggest constraint on doing business in the country.
- Line 12: Social Protection
- Although Panama has cash transfer programs for poverty reduction, their impact is relatively modest due to weaknesses in certification, low coverage, and high leakage.
- Line 13: Gender Equality
- While poverty rates are similar for men and women, gaps exist in other respects that affect women's opportunities and welfare, such as malnutrition and teenage fertility rates, unemployment and employment rates, and low representation in better-paid sectors.
- Line 14: Social Progress
- Panama needs to continue strengthening public investment in basic infrastructure and quality social services, and take a subnational approach to reduce gaps in a way that takes into account crosscutting themes such as gender and diversity, resilience, and climate change adaptation. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the urgent need to foster equitable, sustainable, and quality access.

    - The Social Security Fund (CSS) is at risk of going into deficit sooner than expected, putting pressure on public finances.
    - There is a risk that Panama is unable to get itself taken off the FATF "grey list" in the near term, which could negatively impact correspondent bank relationships and foreign deposits.
    - The rising number of nonperforming and past-due loans could weigh on banks' balance sheets, particularly for smaller and less profitable banks, and constrain the financial system's ability to close the credit gap for MSMEs.
============= 28 ==============
Summary:

- The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has approved a new strategy to support Panama's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. (line 1)

Summary:
- The management of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has responded to the recommendations made by the Office of Evaluation and Oversight (OVE) for the IDB's country program in Panama from 2015-2019.
- The recommendations focused on strengthening interventions in rural and indigenous areas, improving coordination and adaptation to local contexts, and exploring innovative models for service delivery.
- Management agreed with the recommendations and outlined specific actions to address them, including fostering sector and geographic coordination, identifying interventions that require longer time frames and additional resources, offering a range of loan modalities, and exploring innovative models for service delivery.

Categories:
- IDB's response to OVE recommendations
- Rural and indigenous areas
- Coordination and adaptation
- Loan modalities
- Innovative models for service delivery

Lines:
- Recommendation 1: Find mechanisms to continue and strengthen the comprehensive approach to rural and indigenous areas. In particular, i. Foster better sector and geographic coordination of interventions from the design and planning stage. ii. Recognize in the Bank’s programming that the nature of these operations requires greater adaptation to the local context and entails higher costs and longer time frames for preparation, execution, and supervision. iii. To sustainably accommodate these costs, look for ways to promote and offer the country a program that balances the higher costs of these operations with lower-cost operations. iv. To make interventions more cost-effective, the viability and relevance of adapting innovative models implemented in other countries for service delivery in isolated areas (e.g., distance education in Brazil) could be explored in the Panamanian context. 
- Management agrees with OVE on the importance and relevance of continuing work in rural and indigenous areas, where the Bank can add value with its interventions to improve social inclusion and opportunities for the poor. In particular: 
- i. The Bank will continue to foster sector and geographic coordination of interventions from the design stage during the next strategy period. 
- ii. During annual programming exercises with the authorities, the Bank will identify interventions for which additional resources and longer time frames to support design and execution are warranted due to their complexity. 
- iii. The priorities agreed upon between the Bank and the government under the new country strategy and the annual programming exercises will be used to determine which loan modality or intervention type is best to address the country’s development objectives and will be supported by the Bank. The Bank will continue to offer an array of loan modalities, based on the annual allocation of resources for the country. 
- iv. Management will continue exploring innovative models for service delivery in isolated areas.
