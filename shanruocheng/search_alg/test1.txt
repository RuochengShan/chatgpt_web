- The pandemic has also led to rising unemployment, poverty, and inequality, with the impacts falling disproportionately on the most vulnerable groups and women. (Line 7)
- The crisis is more regressive than its predecessors and may have severe repercussions for social welfare and stability. (Line 7)
- Panama faces the double challenge of balancing measures to overcome the most immediate socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic while addressing more structural challenges associated with institutional quality, limited economic diversification, and sharp inequalities in access to basic and productive services.

============= 15 ==============
Summary:

Lessons learned from the Bank's interventions in Panama include weaknesses in public management, the importance of evaluating political feasibility, the need for sector and technical cooperation operations to support reforms, the importance of comprehensive support for crosscutting themes, and the need for dialogue on climate change policies. At the operational level, the Bank's value lies in technical contributions and support for executing agencies, effective dialogue with vulnerable populations, early land titling, and realistic estimates of the time required for ex ante review.

- Line 2.16: Weaknesses in public management limit the effectiveness of investment programs, prioritization of these topics in the Bank’s actions with the country could help improve the effectiveness of public investment projects in general, and of the Bank’s interventions, in particular.
- Line 2.16: Evaluating the political feasibility of institutional change in the sectors prioritized in the strategy is key to determining the sequence and structure of the Bank’s program and the scope of the expected outcomes during the period.
- Line 2.16: In order to support and sustain the reforms fostered by the policy programs, they must be complemented with sector and technical cooperation operations to help the expected outcomes from the reforms to materialize in a timely way.
- Line 2.16: The approach to crosscutting themes like diversity and cultural relevance required extensive and comprehensive support from the analysis of the technical challenges, dialogue with indigenous comarcas to identify needs and solutions, and coordination of a flexible multisectoral response by the Bank.
- Line 2.16: Making headway on the climate change agenda requires dialogue with the authorities to identify policies and investments contributing to the country’s commitments under its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).
- Line 2.17: Given Panama’s good access to external financing, the Bank’s value at the operational level lies in its technical contribution and capacity to support executing agencies on project implementation.
- Line 2.17: Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable population groups effectively requires an investment in substantive dialogue with beneficiaries to achieve relevant solutions, and technical cooperation resources that support operation preparation and execution.
- Line 2.17: Early definition of land titling mitigates the risks of delay to execution of infrastructure works.
- Line 2.17: To improve execution, there need to be realistic estimates of the time the CGR requires for ex ante review of individual contracting processes and associated payments.

- Tax revenues in Panama fell from 10.1% of GDP to 8.7% between 2014 and 2019, the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America and the Caribbean. (Line 34)

- The Panamanian financial system has limited product diversification, strong concentration in a limited number of productive segments and geographic areas, and a strong bias toward large corporates (line 20).

- There is a significant digital divide in rural areas, with telecommunications infrastructure and fixed broadband coverage mainly concentrated in Panama City. (3.22)
- The development of climate-resilient and low-emissions infrastructure that interconnects the country and facilitates market access for rural producers is necessary. (3.23)
- Infrastructure challenges largely derive from low levels of investment outside the central region of the country, together with institutional weaknesses and a lack of planning, prioritization, and preparation of projects, which hinders private-sector involvement. (3.23)
- In the agricultural sector, the policy framework relies on price protection mechanisms rather than services such as agricultural health, resilient and environmentally sustainable productive innovations, and access to finance. (3.24)
